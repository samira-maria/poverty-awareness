      <h2> Causes of Poverty </h2>
      <p> Poverty is not just caused by one aspect, but plenty of issues in one's environment to make it a bigger problem. Some causes of poverty are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="lists"> Lack of access to clean water, healthcare, food, and education </li> 
        <br> 
        <p> More than 2 billion people do not have access to clean water and 800 million around the world suffer from hunger. Food and water insecurity are major reasons on why people struggle to make a living for themselves. If a person does not have enough nutrition, they do not have the strength to work and prevent illness.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p> The term, period poverty, exists since people are unable to obtain sanitary items due to their income. Feminine hygiene products are expensive and women who suffer from poverty often face challenges due to their menstruation needs. In 2019, one in nine women or 13.9 million women live in extreme poverty, meaning that they suffer the most from having barely any money to get clean menstruation products. Since they also have a lack of access to healthcare, they cannot pay for any medical needs that will occur from using unsanitary items they can substitute for feminine hygiene products. </p>
        <br> <br> 
        <li class="lists"> Lack of access to jobs </li> 
        <br> 
        <p> In developing parts of the world, many have been subject to colonialism and had their natural resources plummet. Families and indiviuals struggle to find high paying jobs that can land them a spot out of poverty. People often assume getting a job is that easy, but they have the privilege to live an easier life than those in extreme poverty. </p>
        <br> <br> 
        <li class="lists"> Conflict/War </li>
        <br> 
        <p> Conflict or war can destroy a population, area, and infrastructure. Families can be forced to leave behind everything and an example of that could be Middle Eastern countries like Syria, Yemen, Palestine, and more. Wars often include violence and women usually step up in their households to find well-paying jobs and take care of their families. People constantly have a higher risks of becoming targets of sexual misconducts or violence during these times. </p>
        <br> <br> 
        <li class="lists"> Inequality </li>
        <br> 
        <p> There are various gender, racial, cultural, and caste system inequalities that affect a vast amount of people. These inequalities can hold people or groups back in the community or society from getting a say on important matter. They become more vulnerable to the conditions of poverty and suffer from not receiving enough resources. </p>
        <br> <br> 
        <li class="lists"> Climate change and environmental conditions</li>
        <br> 
        <p> As environments continue to have droughts, flooding, storms, and more, communities suffer from the living conditions. The World Banks estimates that climate change may have pushed more than 100 million people into poverty. Droughts lead to poor harvests and lack of food and water. Furthermore, flooding destroys and displaces many homes while many countries do not provide reliefs or funds for most of the damage. </p>

        <h2> Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking</h2>
        <p> Since people who are subject to poverty have barely any access to education, they have a higher chance of lacking decision-making skills. They are uneducated about exploitation and are often sold off to others for sex. Poverty increases one's vulnerabillities and often result in rape towards women, children, and more. To survive, people believe it is right to sell people off and exploit them due to a tough circumstance people who face poverty are in. Exploiting and trafficking causes barriers in growth as a society and one people who fall into the trap, leaving the trap becomes harder. Our job is to make people more educated and aware of their wellbeings while working to put a stop to these problems. </p>

        <h2> Child Labor </h2>
        <p> Many poor parents are forced to send their children to work instead of receiving an education as education is not free in many countries. Child labor can expose children to hazards while working and problems such as aggression, sleep deprivation, and health issues. Reducing poverty can be a major step in reducing child labor as families struggle due to costs of living rising.</p>
