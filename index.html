    <h2>What is Poverty?</h2>

    <h2>Why does poverty matter?</h2>
    <p> Poverty causes harm to all of us as it builds further into destroying social cohesion and places people in detrimental conditions. People who are subject to poverty are exposed to barely any health care and die between ages 25 and 64 (according to confrontingpoverty.org), which is three times higher within the same age range. Poverty caused social, mental, and physical aspects of daily life for everyone. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Poverty further expands on the growing inequalities to the economic growth of a country and increases political and social tensions. It is our job as a community and society to work together and solve these problems for the next generations. We are today's hands and we can all play a part in our world by making others' lives easier. </p>
