    <p> To learn about poverty, educate yourself and others around you about the issue and how they can help. Schools should expose students more to conditions of others that might be much different from their own. By understanding others' problems, we can build off on what to do as a society to help solve these issues. </p>
        
    <h2> Speak Up </h2>

    <p> Since our generation heavily focuses on technology, use social media to raise awareness on poverty, period poverty, sexual exploitation, child labor, and more issues around the world. We can sign petitions and speak up about what needs to be changed. We can participate in protests and call for changes in which the government can be more alerted about these issues. Furthermore, we can also write to our local officials like senators or governors to focus on this issue more. </p>
  
    <h2> Fund, Donate, Volunteer </h2>
